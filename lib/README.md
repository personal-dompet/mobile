# Lib Directory

This directory contains all the Dart source code for the Dompet mobile application, organized following clean architecture principles.

## Structure

The code is organized into the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer** (`/presentation`) - UI components, screens, and state management
- **Domain Layer** (`/domain`) - Business entities and use cases
- **Data Layer** (`/data`) - Data models, repositories, and local/remote data sources
- **Services** (`/services`) - API clients, authentication services, and storage services
- **Utilities** (`/utils`) - Helper functions, validators, and formatters
- **Configuration** (`/config`) - Application configuration and constants

This separation ensures a clean, maintainable, and testable codebase.
